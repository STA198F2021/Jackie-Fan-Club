		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> <p>The Social Justice Sexuality Project (SJS) is one of the largest national surveys of Black, Latina/o, Asian and Pacific Islander, and multiracial lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. With over 5,000 respondents, the final sample includes respondents from all 50 states; Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico; in rural and suburban areas, in addition to large urban areas; and from a variety of ages, racial/ethnic identities, sexual orientations, and gender identities. The purpose of the SJS Project is to document and celebrate the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people of color. All too often, when we think about LGBT people of color, it's from a perspective of pathology. In contrast, the SJS Project is designed and dedicated to describing a more dynamic experience. It's a knowledge-based study that investigates the sociopolitical experiences of this population around five themes: racial and sexual identity; spirituality and religion; mental and physical health; family formations and dynamics; civic and community engagement. Demographic variables include: race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, education, religion, household, income, height, weight, location, birthplace, and political affiliation.</p><p>Additional information about the SJS Project can be found on the <a href="http://www.socialjusticesexuality.com">Social Justice Sexuality Project</a> Web site.</p></span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The purpose of the SJS Project is to document and celebrate the experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people of color. All too often, when we think about LGBT people of color, it's from a perspective of pathology. in contrast, the SJS Project is designed and dedicated to describing a more dynamic experience.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Study Design:</strong> The SJS researchers tested and re-tested the survey before use in the field in 2010 (January-December). The original, 105-item survey, administered to approximately 5,000 people.
The research team also administered a supplement to approximately 600 people at the GMHC House of Latex Ball (August, 2010). This version of the survey included 10 additional items about the House and Ball community, about mobile technology, and about contact with police. Questions that appear only in the supplement are indicated by the letter "G" before the question number.
Both surveys were approved by the CUNY-Graduate Center Institutional Review Board (IRB) for the ethnical use with human subjects.
The sample for the study was generated through a variety of strategies, including: venue-based sampling at strategic events, snowball sampling, respondent-driven sampling, and the Internet (20 percent).</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> Convenient sampling. Used the census data to map out where people of color, and LGBT people lived and went there to survey the desired population.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Cross-sectional</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Black, Latina/o, Asian and Pacific Islander, and multiracial lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> individual</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> mail questionnaire, on-site questionnaire, web-based survey</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Description of Variables:</strong> Many variables include questions looking at the respondents' opinion about various topics and experiences, with particular focus on LGBT communities and people of color.
Demographic variables include: race/ethnicity, gender identity, relationship status, age, location, religious affiliation, employment status, height, weight</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> Response rate for each sample: 99.06 percent</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Presence of Common Scales:</strong> Several Likert-type scales and semantic differential scales were used.</span></p>
