# Background, Data, and Research Question

---

## Background

We chose this topic because we want to highlight interesting trends in intersectional inequality between historically marginalized identities within race, sexuality, and gender. We are motivated to ask our question from backgrounds of interest in health, racial justice, and wanting to examine US-based data. 

---


## Data

Our project uses data collected by the Social Justice Sexuality Project (SJS) through the University of Michigan’s Resource Center for Minority Data

--

- surveyed over 5,000 participants

- from January of 2010 to December of 2010

- respondents were Black, Latina/o, Asian and Pacific Islander, and multiracial lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in 50 US states and Puerto Rico

- survey given via mail questionnaire, on-site questionnaire, and web-based survey in Spanish and English depending on the respondent.

## Data Wrangling
We had data that was not in a suitable form to be visualized or analyzed. Thus, we used data wrangling to synthesize many responses into a single variable. 

--

- Race
  - Since respondents could pick multiple selections, we synthesized multiple selections into a single variable. If respondents selected multiple races, they would be listed as multiracial. This means that the multiracial category encompass many identities, so we must proceed with caution when analyzing its significance. 
  
- Gender
  - Since respondents could pick multiple selections or specify other, we collapsed all the answers into a single variable. If respondents selected multiple genders or listed their own, they would be categorized as other. When conducting analyses, we differentiated between cis and transgender individuals for ease of analysis.

- Sexuality
  - When conducting data analyses, we differentiated between queer and straight individuals for ease of analysis.

## Preliminary Data Visualizations

.pull-left[
We included some data visualizations to demonstrate the simplifications we made to efficiently test our data. This is a visualization of the distribution of gender identity responses. When we conducted significant tests on gender we sorted respondents by cisgender and transgender to identify how marginalized groups were affected in the healthcare process.

## Preliminary Data Visualizations

.pull-left[
&lt;img src="presentation_files/figure-html/health-insurance-gender-1.png" width="100%" /&gt;
]
.pull-right[
After we looked at the distribution of data and made decisions about which factors we wanted to study further, we then began to match up explainatory variables with response variables. In this case, we were observing how gender identity affected healthcare insurance access.

The visualizations show that a greater percentage of transgender individuals answered "no" than cisgender individuals. The greatest percentage of "no" responses came from the group of self-identified female to male transgender individuals. Also, when comparing the gender groups, note that there are more missing values for transgendered individuals than cisgendered respondents, which may provide more insight to the disparity. It appears tentatively that one's gender identity may have a relationship to access to healthcare.

## Research Question

Central research question:
- How do sexuality, race, and gender affect healthcare access?

--

We followed up by asking:

- Are marginalized groups disadvantaged in their health outcomes? 

- How much more significant are the disparities at intersections of multiple marginalized identities? 

--

Our hypothesis is that those who exist at the intersection of marginalized minority groups in race, sexuality, or gender would have compounded impacts of inequality than if they were only representing one of the marginalized identities. For example, someone who is  black and queer would face more negative health outcomes as opposed to someone who’s either black or queer.

# Data Analysis

---

## Single-Variable Logistic Regression

We ran a multiple logistic regression for health insurance access and health provider access conditional on gender, race, and sexuality. 
.footnote[
[*] We just distinguished between heterosexual and all other sexuality answers in our models. 
] 

- The most negatively affected identity group in regards to health insurance access was Hispanic individuals, followed by transgender individuals, followed by multiracial individuals, followed by native individuals. 

- The most negatively affected identity group in regards to whether or not someone has access to a regular healthcare provider or not, we found that the most negatively affected identity group was transgender, followed by Hispanic, and followed by black individuals. 

- For example, our referent group of white, cis, heterosexual individuals are 1.46 times more likely to have health insurance than non-white, trans, non-heterosexual counterparts.

- They are also 1.32 times more likely to have access to a regular healthcare provider than marginalized identities.

## Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &amp;#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders `\(\alpha+\beta\)`. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

`$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$`

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

## Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect the majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer.

- And if you want more bells and whistles, there is also `xaringanExtra`: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra.
